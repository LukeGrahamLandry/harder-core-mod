# Harder Core Mod
 
A minecraft mod for forge 1.16.3 that makes the game harder

## Features 
- Killer shadows
    - Spawn quickly in darkness and die immediately in daylight
    - Drop scales that can craft into food or charms that prevent their spawning
    - spawning also prevented by holding a torch
- In game help book that lists these features
- Extra realism for hunger and sleeping
    - Being hungry causes slowness and weakness
    - Not sleeping causes slowness, reduced attack speed, nausea and death
    - Eating raw meat gives nausea and either poison or hunger
- Temperature (displayed in top left)
    - effected by biome, armor, being on fire and nearby blocks
    - when warm, drinking water cools you down
    - extremes give you hypothermia (slow move/attack) or heat stroke (nausea) both cause weakness and deal damage
    - craft charms to hold in your inventory for immunity to different temperatures
- Air Quality (displayed above food when not full)
    - reduced by being within 3 blocks of fire, torches, blazes or lit furnaces, raised by time spent outside
    - too low quality causes nausea, hunger and damage
    - oxygen canisters slowly fill up with air, drink from them to recover air quality (or breath bubbles) quickly
- Water (displayed above food)
    - decreases over time, faster in hot biomes
    - drink water bottles, potions or milk (or go for a swim or eat melon) to increase
    - hold lots of water in a hydro flask (upgrade your flask to automatically drink while in your inventory)
    - too low causes nausea and damage
- Chance for buffed mobs to spawn
    - some give poison or fire on hit
    - some dodge projectiles (like endermen)
- Blood moon
    - once every 8 nights hoards of monsters spawn and you can't sleep
    - mobs spawned by the blood moon disappear at day break
    - can be summoned early with a Totem of the Blood Moon
- Gravestones
    - when you die a gravestone holding your items spawns (along with an undead)
    - right click it to return your items to the same slots of your inventory or break it to drop them on the ground
    - the gravestone is immune to explosions and if you die in a block or the void it will move upwards to the closest air/fluid
